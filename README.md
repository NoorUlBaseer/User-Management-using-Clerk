## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Clerk account

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoorUlBaseer/User-Management-using-Clerk.git
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   npm install
   ```
   **Note**: Do not navigate directly into the `backend` folder for backend setup.

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   Create `.env` files in both `backend` and `frontend` folders:

   **Backend `.env`**:
   ```
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   ```

   **Frontend `.env`**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   ```

   *Note*: Obtain these keys from your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/)

5. **Running the Application**

   **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   npm run dev
   ```
   **Note**: Do not navigate into the `backend` folder, as the `package.json` file is configured to run the `backend/index.js` file.

   **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Using the Application

After starting both the backend and frontend:

1. **Access the Application**
   - Open a web browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (default React development server)

2. **Landing Page**
   - You'll see the home page with "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons.

3. **Authentication**
   - Click "Sign Up" to create a new account.
     - Enter your email
     - Create a password
     - Complete any additional verification steps
   - Or click "Sign In" if you already have an account.

4. **Dashboard Access**
   - After successful authentication, you'll be automatically redirected to your personal dashboard.
   - The dashboard displays:
     - Personalized welcome message
     - Your User ID
     - Username (if set)
     - Email address

5. **Signing Out**
   - On the dashboard, click the "Sign Out" button to log out.
   - You'll be redirected back to the home page.

## Security Features

- Protected routes using Clerk's `SignedIn` and `SignedOut` components.
- Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users.
- Secure sign-out before window/tab closure
- Server-side user verification

## Customization

- Modify `styles.css` to change application styling.
- Adjust route configurations in `App.js`.
- Customize dashboard display in `Dashboard.js`.

## Error Handling

- Console logs for authentication and data fetching errors.
- User-friendly loading states
- Fallback routes for authentication

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Clerk Key**: Ensure that the Clerk API keys are correctly placed in your `.env` files. Double-check that the keys are from your Clerk account.

- **Backend Errors**: Check the server logs for specific error messages and ensure that the Clerk SDK is correctly initialized.

- **CORS Issues**: If you encounter CORS issues, ensure that `cors()` middleware is correctly set up in the `backend/index.js` file.

Please review these troubleshooting steps if you encounter any issues while running the application. If the problem persists, feel free to reach out for further assistance.
